### **Understanding the Question:**  
*"Find the movie names where one or more actors acted in two or more movies."*  

- **Keywords:**  
  - *"movie names"* → We need to retrieve `Mov_Title` from the `MOVIES` table.  
  - *"one or more actors acted in two or more movies"* → We need to identify actors (`Act_id`) who have appeared in **at least two different movies** (`Mov_id`).  

---

### **Breaking It Down into Steps:**  
1. **Find actors who acted in 2 or more movies.**  
   - This means counting how many different `Mov_id` values each `Act_id` appears in inside the `MOVIE_CAST` table.  
   - If an actor appears in 2 or more movies, we need to filter those actors.  

2. **Get the movies in which these actors acted.**  
   - Once we identify the `Act_id` values that appear in multiple movies, we can extract the `Mov_id` values corresponding to those actors.  

3. **Retrieve the movie names (`Mov_Title`).**  
   - Using the `Mov_id` values, fetch the movie titles from the `MOVIES` table.

### **Converting This into SQL:**  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT MOVIES.Mov_Title 
FROM MOVIES 
JOIN MOVIE_CAST ON MOVIES.Mov_id = MOVIE_CAST.Mov_id 
WHERE MOVIE_CAST.Act_id IN (
    SELECT Act_id 
    FROM MOVIE_CAST 
    GROUP BY Act_id 
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Mov_id) >= 2
);
```

### **Explanation of the SQL Query:**  
1. **Inner Query (Subquery):**  
   ```sql
   SELECT Act_id 
   FROM MOVIE_CAST 
   GROUP BY Act_id 
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Mov_id) >= 2
   ```
   - Groups the `MOVIE_CAST` table by `Act_id` (each actor).  
   - Uses `COUNT(DISTINCT Mov_id) >= 2` to find actors who have acted in **2 or more** movies.  
   - Returns a list of `Act_id` values for these actors.  

2. **Outer Query:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT MOVIES.Mov_Title 
   FROM MOVIES 
   JOIN MOVIE_CAST ON MOVIES.Mov_id = MOVIE_CAST.Mov_id 
   WHERE MOVIE_CAST.Act_id IN (...)
   ```
   - Joins `MOVIES` and `MOVIE_CAST` tables using `Mov_id`.  
   - Filters movies where `Act_id` matches any actor from the subquery.  
   - Uses `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicate movie titles.  

---

### **Alternative Using `JOIN` Instead of a Subquery:**  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT MOVIES.Mov_Title 
FROM MOVIES 
JOIN MOVIE_CAST ON MOVIES.Mov_id = MOVIE_CAST.Mov_id 
JOIN (
    SELECT Act_id 
    FROM MOVIE_CAST 
    GROUP BY Act_id 
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Mov_id) >= 2
) AS MultiMovieActors ON MOVIE_CAST.Act_id = MultiMovieActors.Act_id;
```
- This method directly joins the filtered actors instead of using `IN`.

### **Which One to Use?**  
- **The first query (subquery method)** is easier to understand and works well for beginners.  
- **The second query (JOIN method)** is optimized for large datasets in SQL engines like MySQL.
