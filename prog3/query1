### **Understanding the Question:**
**"List the titles of all movies directed by ‘Christopher Nolan’."**

- **Keywords:**
  - *"titles of all movies"* → We need to select movie titles from the `MOVIES` table.
  - *"directed by ‘Christopher Nolan’"* → We need to filter movies where the director is **Christopher Nolan**.
  
### **Breaking It into Simple Steps:**
1. Find **Christopher Nolan** in the `DIRECTOR` table (search by `Dir_Name`).
2. Get the **Dir_id** (Director ID) from the `DIRECTOR` table.
3. Use this `Dir_id` to find all movies he directed in the `MOVIES` table.
4. Display only the `Mov_Title` (movie titles).

### **Converting It to SQL:**
```sql
SELECT Mov_Title 
FROM MOVIES 
WHERE Dir_id = (
    SELECT Dir_id 
    FROM DIRECTOR 
    WHERE Dir_Name = 'Christopher Nolan'
);
```

---

### **Explanation of the SQL Query:**
1. `SELECT Mov_Title FROM MOVIES` → Selects movie titles from the `MOVIES` table.
2. `WHERE Dir_id = (...)` → Filters movies by the `Dir_id` of Christopher Nolan.
3. **Subquery:**  
   - `SELECT Dir_id FROM DIRECTOR WHERE Dir_Name = 'Christopher Nolan'`  
   - Finds the `Dir_id` of Christopher Nolan from the `DIRECTOR` table.
4. The outer query uses this `Dir_id` to get all movies directed by him.

### **Alternative Using `JOIN`:**
Another way to write the query using `JOIN`:
```sql
SELECT MOVIES.Mov_Title 
FROM MOVIES 
JOIN DIRECTOR ON MOVIES.Dir_id = DIRECTOR.Dir_id 
WHERE DIRECTOR.Dir_Name = 'Christopher Nolan';
```
- Here, we **join** `MOVIES` and `DIRECTOR` tables using `Dir_id` to directly filter by `Dir_Name`.

### **Which One to Use?**
- **Subquery** is simple and works well when filtering based on a single lookup.
- **JOIN** is preferred for performance when working with large datasets.
