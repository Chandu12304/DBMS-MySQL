#### **Step 1: Understand the Requirement**  
The question asks for **all student details** who are studying in the **fourth semester, C section**.  

This means we need to:  
1. **Find students** who belong to **Semester 4 and Section C** from the **SEMSEC** table.  
2. **Find their USNs** from the **CLASS** table, which links students to their semester and section (SSID).  
3. **Get the full student details** from the **STUDENT** table using the USNs.

---

#### **Step 2: Identify the Required Tables**  
- **SEMSEC (SSID, Sem, Sec)** → Contains semester and section details.  
- **CLASS (USN, SSID)** → Links students to their semester-section (SSID).  
- **STUDENT (USN, SName, Address, Phone, Gender)** → Contains student details.

#### **Step 3: Break it Down into SQL Query**
1. **Find SSID for Sem = 4 and Sec = 'C'**  
   ```sql
   SELECT SSID FROM SEMSEC WHERE Sem = 4 AND Sec = 'C';
   ```
2. **Find USNs from CLASS table where SSID matches**  
   ```sql
   SELECT USN FROM CLASS WHERE SSID IN (SELECT SSID FROM SEMSEC WHERE Sem = 4 AND Sec = 'C');
   ```
3. **Retrieve full student details for those USNs**  
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM STUDENT WHERE USN IN (
       SELECT USN FROM CLASS WHERE SSID IN (SELECT SSID FROM SEMSEC WHERE Sem = 4 AND Sec = 'C')
   );
   ```

---

### **Final SQL Query**
```sql
SELECT * FROM STUDENT 
WHERE USN IN (
    SELECT USN FROM CLASS 
    WHERE SSID IN (SELECT SSID FROM SEMSEC WHERE Sem = 4 AND Sec = 'C')
);
```

This query will give **all student details** who are in the **4th semester, C section**.

---

### **Summary of Steps in Simple Terms**  
1. **Find SSID** of "4th semester, C section".  
2. **Find students (USNs) linked to that SSID** in CLASS table.  
3. **Get student details** from the STUDENT table using the USNs.
