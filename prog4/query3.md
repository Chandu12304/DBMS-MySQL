  

#### **Step 1: Understand the Requirement**  
We need to **create a view** that displays **Test1 marks** for a student with **USN '1BI15CS101'** in **all subjects**.  

This means:  
1. **Find Test1 marks** for the given USN from the **IAMARKS** table.  
2. **Get subject details** from the **SUBJECT** table.  
3. **Create a view** that stores and retrieves this data easily.

---

#### **Step 2: Identify the Required Tables**  
- **IAMARKS (USN, Subcode, Test1)** → Contains Test1 marks for students.  
- **SUBJECT (Subcode, Title)** → Contains subject names (Title) corresponding to subject codes (Subcode).  

---

#### **Step 3: Break it Down into SQL Query**  
1. **Find Test1 marks** for the given student (`USN = '1BI15CS101'`).  
   ```sql
   SELECT Subcode, Test1 
   FROM IAMARKS 
   WHERE USN = '1BI15CS101';
   ```
2. **Join with the SUBJECT table** to get subject names.  
   ```sql
   SELECT SUBJECT.Title, IAMARKS.Test1 
   FROM IAMARKS 
   JOIN SUBJECT ON IAMARKS.Subcode = SUBJECT.Subcode 
   WHERE IAMARKS.USN = '1BI15CS101';
   ```
3. **Create a view** to store and reuse this query.  
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW Test1MarksView AS
   SELECT SUBJECT.Title, IAMARKS.Test1 
   FROM IAMARKS 
   JOIN SUBJECT ON IAMARKS.Subcode = SUBJECT.Subcode 
   WHERE IAMARKS.USN = '1BI15CS101';
   ```

---

### **Final SQL Query**
```sql
CREATE VIEW Test1MarksView AS
SELECT SUBJECT.Title, IAMARKS.Test1 
FROM IAMARKS 
JOIN SUBJECT ON IAMARKS.Subcode = SUBJECT.Subcode 
WHERE IAMARKS.USN = '1BI15CS101';
```

To **view the results**, use:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Test1MarksView;
```

---

### **Summary of Steps in Simple Terms**  
1. **Find Test1 marks** for student `'1BI15CS101'`.  
2. **Get subject names** by joining with the **SUBJECT** table.  
3. **Create a view** so that the results can be accessed easily.
