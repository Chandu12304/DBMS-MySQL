#### **Step 1: Understand the Requirement**  
We need to **count the number of male and female students** in **each semester and section**.  

This means:  
1. **Group students** by semester (`Sem`) and section (`Sec`).  
2. **Count how many males ('M') and females ('F')** are in each group.  
3. **Retrieve and display** the semester, section, gender, and count of students.

#### **Step 2: Identify the Required Tables**  
- **STUDENT (USN, Gender)** → Tells us the gender of each student.  
- **CLASS (USN, SSID)** → Links each student to their semester and section (SSID).  
- **SEMSEC (SSID, Sem, Sec)** → Tells us the semester and section for each SSID.

#### **Step 3: Break it Down into SQL Query**
1. **Join CLASS with STUDENT** to get gender information for each student.  
   ```sql
   SELECT CLASS.USN, CLASS.SSID, STUDENT.Gender 
   FROM CLASS 
   JOIN STUDENT ON CLASS.USN = STUDENT.USN;
   ```
2. **Join with SEMSEC** to get the semester and section.  
   ```sql
   SELECT SEMSEC.Sem, SEMSEC.Sec, STUDENT.Gender 
   FROM CLASS 
   JOIN STUDENT ON CLASS.USN = STUDENT.USN
   JOIN SEMSEC ON CLASS.SSID = SEMSEC.SSID;
   ```
3. **Count students grouped by semester, section, and gender**  
   ```sql
   SELECT SEMSEC.Sem, SEMSEC.Sec, STUDENT.Gender, COUNT(*) AS TotalStudents
   FROM CLASS 
   JOIN STUDENT ON CLASS.USN = STUDENT.USN
   JOIN SEMSEC ON CLASS.SSID = SEMSEC.SSID
   GROUP BY SEMSEC.Sem, SEMSEC.Sec, STUDENT.Gender;
   ```

---

### **Final SQL Query**
```sql
SELECT SEMSEC.Sem, SEMSEC.Sec, STUDENT.Gender, COUNT(*) AS TotalStudents
FROM CLASS 
JOIN STUDENT ON CLASS.USN = STUDENT.USN
JOIN SEMSEC ON CLASS.SSID = SEMSEC.SSID
GROUP BY SEMSEC.Sem, SEMSEC.Sec, STUDENT.Gender;
```

---

### **Summary of Steps in Simple Terms**  
1. **Join tables** to link students to their semester and section.  
2. **Group by semester, section, and gender** to count students.  
3. **Display results** with the total number of male and female students in each semester-section.
