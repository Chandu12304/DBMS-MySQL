#### **Step 1: Understand the Requirement**  
We need to **categorize students based on their FinalIA marks** and **list only 8th semester students from A, B, and C sections**.  

This means:  
1. **Filter students** who are in **8th semester, sections A, B, or C**.  
2. **Check their FinalIA score** and assign a category (CAT):  
   - **17 to 20** → ‘Outstanding’  
   - **12 to 16** → ‘Average’  
   - **Less than 12** → ‘Weak’  
3. **Display student details** along with their category.

#### **Step 2: Identify the Required Tables**  
- **IAMARKS (USN, FinalIA)** → Contains the FinalIA marks for each student.  
- **CLASS (USN, SSID)** → Links students to their semester and section (SSID).  
- **SEMSEC (SSID, Sem, Sec)** → Contains semester and section details.  
- **STUDENT (USN, SName)** → Contains student names for better readability.  

---

#### **Step 3: Break it Down into SQL Query**  
1. **Filter students in 8th semester, section A, B, or C**  
   ```sql
   SELECT USN 
   FROM CLASS 
   WHERE SSID IN (SELECT SSID FROM SEMSEC WHERE Sem = 8 AND Sec IN ('A', 'B', 'C'));
   ```
2. **Join with IAMARKS to get FinalIA marks**  
   ```sql
   SELECT IAMARKS.USN, IAMARKS.FinalIA 
   FROM IAMARKS 
   JOIN CLASS ON IAMARKS.USN = CLASS.USN 
   WHERE CLASS.SSID IN (SELECT SSID FROM SEMSEC WHERE Sem = 8 AND Sec IN ('A', 'B', 'C'));
   ```
3. **Use CASE to assign categories based on FinalIA**  
   ```sql
   SELECT STUDENT.USN, STUDENT.SName, IAMARKS.FinalIA,
   CASE 
       WHEN IAMARKS.FinalIA BETWEEN 17 AND 20 THEN 'Outstanding'
       WHEN IAMARKS.FinalIA BETWEEN 12 AND 16 THEN 'Average'
       WHEN IAMARKS.FinalIA < 12 THEN 'Weak'
   END AS CAT
   FROM IAMARKS
   JOIN CLASS ON IAMARKS.USN = CLASS.USN
   JOIN SEMSEC ON CLASS.SSID = SEMSEC.SSID
   JOIN STUDENT ON IAMARKS.USN = STUDENT.USN
   WHERE SEMSEC.Sem = 8 AND SEMSEC.Sec IN ('A', 'B', 'C');
   ```

---

### **Final SQL Query**
```sql
SELECT STUDENT.USN, STUDENT.SName, IAMARKS.FinalIA,
CASE 
    WHEN IAMARKS.FinalIA BETWEEN 17 AND 20 THEN 'Outstanding'
    WHEN IAMARKS.FinalIA BETWEEN 12 AND 16 THEN 'Average'
    WHEN IAMARKS.FinalIA < 12 THEN 'Weak'
END AS CAT
FROM IAMARKS
JOIN CLASS ON IAMARKS.USN = CLASS.USN
JOIN SEMSEC ON CLASS.SSID = SEMSEC.SSID
JOIN STUDENT ON IAMARKS.USN = STUDENT.USN
WHERE SEMSEC.Sem = 8 AND SEMSEC.Sec IN ('A', 'B', 'C');
```

---

### **Summary of Steps in Simple Terms**  
1. **Find 8th semester students** from A, B, and C sections.  
2. **Retrieve their FinalIA marks** from IAMARKS.  
3. **Use CASE to categorize them** as Outstanding, Average, or Weak.  
4. **Display their USN, Name, FinalIA, and Category**.

This query will give the **categorized list of students** in 8th semester A, B, and C sections. Let me know if you need any changes!

#### **Step 1: Understand the Requirement**  
We need to **categorize students** based on their `FinalIA` scores and **list only 8th semester students from A, B, and C sections**, **without using CASE**.

This means:  
1. **Filter students** who are in **8th semester, sections A, B, or C**.  
2. **Use multiple `SELECT` queries combined with `UNION`** to categorize them.  
3. **Display student details** along with their category.

---

#### **Step 2: Identify the Required Tables**  
- **IAMARKS (USN, FinalIA)** → Contains the FinalIA marks for each student.  
- **CLASS (USN, SSID)** → Links students to their semester and section (SSID).  
- **SEMSEC (SSID, Sem, Sec)** → Contains semester and section details.  
- **STUDENT (USN, SName)** → Contains student names.  

---

#### **Step 3: Break it Down into SQL Query Using UNION**  
Since `CASE` cannot be used, we create **three separate queries** for each category and combine them using `UNION`.

1. **Get Outstanding students (FinalIA between 17 and 20)**  
   ```sql
   SELECT STUDENT.USN, STUDENT.SName, IAMARKS.FinalIA, 'Outstanding' AS CAT
   FROM IAMARKS
   JOIN CLASS ON IAMARKS.USN = CLASS.USN
   JOIN SEMSEC ON CLASS.SSID = SEMSEC.SSID
   JOIN STUDENT ON IAMARKS.USN = STUDENT.USN
   WHERE SEMSEC.Sem = 8 AND SEMSEC.Sec IN ('A', 'B', 'C') AND IAMARKS.FinalIA BETWEEN 17 AND 20
   ```

2. **Get Average students (FinalIA between 12 and 16)**  
   ```sql
   SELECT STUDENT.USN, STUDENT.SName, IAMARKS.FinalIA, 'Average' AS CAT
   FROM IAMARKS
   JOIN CLASS ON IAMARKS.USN = CLASS.USN
   JOIN SEMSEC ON CLASS.SSID = SEMSEC.SSID
   JOIN STUDENT ON IAMARKS.USN = STUDENT.USN
   WHERE SEMSEC.Sem = 8 AND SEMSEC.Sec IN ('A', 'B', 'C') AND IAMARKS.FinalIA BETWEEN 12 AND 16
   ```

3. **Get Weak students (FinalIA < 12)**  
   ```sql
   SELECT STUDENT.USN, STUDENT.SName, IAMARKS.FinalIA, 'Weak' AS CAT
   FROM IAMARKS
   JOIN CLASS ON IAMARKS.USN = CLASS.USN
   JOIN SEMSEC ON CLASS.SSID = SEMSEC.SSID
   JOIN STUDENT ON IAMARKS.USN = STUDENT.USN
   WHERE SEMSEC.Sem = 8 AND SEMSEC.Sec IN ('A', 'B', 'C') AND IAMARKS.FinalIA < 12
   ```

4. **Combine all three queries using UNION**  
   ```sql
   SELECT STUDENT.USN, STUDENT.SName, IAMARKS.FinalIA, 'Outstanding' AS CAT
   FROM IAMARKS
   JOIN CLASS ON IAMARKS.USN = CLASS.USN
   JOIN SEMSEC ON CLASS.SSID = SEMSEC.SSID
   JOIN STUDENT ON IAMARKS.USN = STUDENT.USN
   WHERE SEMSEC.Sem = 8 AND SEMSEC.Sec IN ('A', 'B', 'C') AND IAMARKS.FinalIA BETWEEN 17 AND 20

   UNION

   SELECT STUDENT.USN, STUDENT.SName, IAMARKS.FinalIA, 'Average' AS CAT
   FROM IAMARKS
   JOIN CLASS ON IAMARKS.USN = CLASS.USN
   JOIN SEMSEC ON CLASS.SSID = SEMSEC.SSID
   JOIN STUDENT ON IAMARKS.USN = STUDENT.USN
   WHERE SEMSEC.Sem = 8 AND SEMSEC.Sec IN ('A', 'B', 'C') AND IAMARKS.FinalIA BETWEEN 12 AND 16

   UNION

   SELECT STUDENT.USN, STUDENT.SName, IAMARKS.FinalIA, 'Weak' AS CAT
   FROM IAMARKS
   JOIN CLASS ON IAMARKS.USN = CLASS.USN
   JOIN SEMSEC ON CLASS.SSID = SEMSEC.SSID
   JOIN STUDENT ON IAMARKS.USN = STUDENT.USN
   WHERE SEMSEC.Sem = 8 AND SEMSEC.Sec IN ('A', 'B', 'C') AND IAMARKS.FinalIA < 12;
   ```

### **Summary of Steps in Simple Terms**  
1. **Find 8th semester students** from sections A, B, and C.  
2. **Filter students based on their FinalIA scores** using three separate queries.  
3. **Assign categories manually using UNION** instead of CASE.  
4. **Combine the results** to get a complete list.  

This method achieves the same result **without using CASE**. Let me know if you need further explanations!
