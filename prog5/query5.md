The question asks us to **retrieve the department number (DNo)** and the **count of employees earning more than ₹6,00,000**, but only for **departments that have more than 5 employees**.  

To solve this, we will:  
1. **Count the total number of employees per department**.  
2. **Filter departments that have more than 5 employees**.  
3. **Count how many of those employees earn more than ₹6,00,000**.

### **Step 1: Identify Relevant Tables**  
- **EMPLOYEE (SSN, Name, Address, Sex, Salary, SuperSSN, DNo)** → Contains `DNo` (Department Number) and `Salary`.  
- **DEPARTMENT (DNo, DName, MgrSSN, MgrStartDate)** → Defines department details but is **not needed** here because we already get `DNo` from `EMPLOYEE`.

### **Step 2: Count Total Employees per Department**
We first count **the number of employees in each department**:

```sql
SELECT DNo, COUNT(*) AS Total_Employees
FROM EMPLOYEE
GROUP BY DNo
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

This filters out departments **with 5 or fewer employees**.

### **Step 3: Count Employees Earning More than ₹6,00,000**
Now, we count **employees earning more than ₹6,00,000** in those departments:

```sql
SELECT DNo, COUNT(*) AS High_Salary_Employees
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Salary > 600000
GROUP BY DNo
HAVING DNo IN (
    SELECT DNo 
    FROM EMPLOYEE 
    GROUP BY DNo 
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
);
```

### **Final Explanation**
1. **Find the department numbers (`DNo`) where more than 5 employees exist**.  
2. **Filter only those employees earning more than ₹6,00,000**.  
3. **Count how many such employees exist per department**.  

This query ensures we get **only departments with more than 5 employees** and **shows the count of high-earning employees in each department**. Let me know if you need further clarification!
