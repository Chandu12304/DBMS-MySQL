The question asks us to find **all project numbers** where an **employee named ‘Scott’** is either:  
1. **A worker on the project** (i.e., listed in the `WORKS_ON` table)  
2. **A manager of the department** that controls the project (i.e., the manager of the department that owns the project in the `DEPARTMENT` table).

### **Step 1: Identify Relevant Tables**
- **EMPLOYEE (SSN, Name, Address, Sex, Salary, SuperSSN, DNo)** → To find employees with the last name **Scott**.  
- **DEPARTMENT (DNo, DName, MgrSSN, MgrStartDate)** → To find out if an employee named **Scott** is a manager.  
- **PROJECT (PNo, PName, PLocation, DNo)** → To check which department controls each project.  
- **WORKS_ON (SSN, PNo, Hours)** → To check if an employee named **Scott** works on a project.

### **Step 2: Find Employees with Last Name ‘Scott’**
We need to extract **SSNs** of employees whose last name is `Scott`. Assuming that names are stored as `"First Last"`, we use `LIKE '%Scott'` to filter names ending in "Scott".  

```sql
SELECT SSN FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Name LIKE '%Scott';
```

---

### **Step 3: Find Projects Where ‘Scott’ is a Worker**  
Join `WORKS_ON` with `EMPLOYEE` to get projects where an employee named ‘Scott’ is working.  

```sql
SELECT PNo 
FROM WORKS_ON 
WHERE SSN IN (SELECT SSN FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Name LIKE '%Scott');
```

---

### **Step 4: Find Projects Where ‘Scott’ is a Manager**  
1. First, **find the departments** where the manager’s name is ‘Scott’:  

```sql
SELECT DNo 
FROM DEPARTMENT 
WHERE MgrSSN IN (SELECT SSN FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Name LIKE '%Scott');
```

2. Then, **find projects controlled by these departments**:  

```sql
SELECT PNo 
FROM PROJECT 
WHERE DNo IN (SELECT DNo FROM DEPARTMENT WHERE MgrSSN IN (SELECT SSN FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Name LIKE '%Scott'));
```

---

### **Step 5: Combine Both Queries (Using UNION)**
Since we need projects where **Scott is either a worker or a manager**, we use `UNION` to merge the two results.

```sql
SELECT PNo 
FROM WORKS_ON 
WHERE SSN IN (SELECT SSN FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Name LIKE '%Scott')
UNION 
SELECT PNo 
FROM PROJECT 
WHERE DNo IN (SELECT DNo FROM DEPARTMENT WHERE MgrSSN IN (SELECT SSN FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Name LIKE '%Scott'));
```

---

### **Final Explanation**
1. **Find all SSNs of employees whose last name is ‘Scott’**.  
2. **Check if any of these SSNs are in WORKS_ON** (meaning they work on a project).  
3. **Check if any of these SSNs are in DEPARTMENT as a manager**.  
4. **Get the project numbers from WORKS_ON and PROJECT, then combine results**.  

This is the simplest way to break down and solve the problem in SQL. Let me know if you need further clarification!
