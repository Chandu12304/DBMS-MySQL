The question asks us to **retrieve the names of employees** who work on **all projects** controlled by department number **5**.  

To solve this, we use the `NOT EXISTS` operator, which helps us check if there is any **project controlled by department 5** that an employee **does not work on**.

### **Step 1: Identify Relevant Tables**  
- **PROJECT (PNo, PName, PLocation, DNo)** → To get all projects controlled by **department number 5**.  
- **WORKS_ON (SSN, PNo, Hours)** → To check if an **employee (SSN)** is working on these projects.  
- **EMPLOYEE (SSN, Name, Address, Sex, Salary, SuperSSN, DNo)** → To get the **names** of these employees.

### **Step 2: Find All Projects Controlled by Department 5**  
Since `PROJECT` contains the department number (`DNo`), we find all `PNo` (Project Numbers) controlled by **department 5**:

```sql
SELECT PNo 
FROM PROJECT 
WHERE DNo = 5;
```

### **Step 3: Find Employees Who Work on All These Projects**
To ensure an employee **works on ALL these projects**, we check if there exists any project **controlled by department 5** that an employee **does not work on**.  

Using `NOT EXISTS`, we express this condition:

```sql
SELECT Name 
FROM EMPLOYEE E
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT PNo 
    FROM PROJECT 
    WHERE DNo = 5
    AND PNo NOT IN (SELECT PNo FROM WORKS_ON WHERE SSN = E.SSN)
);
```

---

### **Step 4: Understanding `NOT EXISTS`**
- The **inner query** finds all projects controlled by department 5.  
- The **second inner query** checks if an employee **does NOT work on one of these projects**.  
- If such a project exists, the employee **is excluded**.  
- If `NOT EXISTS` is **true**, it means the employee **works on all required projects**.

### **Final Explanation**
1. **Find the projects** (`PNo`) controlled by department 5.  
2. **Check for each employee** if there is any project **they are missing**.  
3. **If an employee works on all projects**, they are included in the result.  

This ensures we get only those employees who **work on every single project** of department 5. Let me know if you need more explanation!
